# Bicycles
*June 2025*

When people think of tools, they tend to imagine something that lives in a garage or a toolbox. But tools are just anything that amplifies human effort. The bicycle is one of the most effective tools we’ve ever made. It’s not just a way to get around—it’s a multiplier.

The most striking thing about bicycles is how efficiently they convert effort into motion. The classic study at Scientific American once showed that the bicycle is the most efficient form of locomotion known—not just among human-made vehicles, but across the entire animal kingdom. A human on a bicycle uses less energy per distance than a condor in flight.

This should be surprising. A condor is built by evolution; a bicycle is built in a garage. But in some ways, that’s the point. The bicycle is a distillation of intelligence. It’s what happens when you apply reason to the problem of moving. Evolution is a brute-force algorithm. The bicycle is a proof.

Bicycles also embody an interesting kind of leverage. You can’t coast on your feet the way you can on a bike. Going downhill, a bike gives back some of what you put in. It’s like compound interest. Most tools are passive—they help you do something, but they don’t help themselves do it. A bicycle is partly alive.

And like all good tools, bicycles hide complexity behind a simple interface. Push on the pedals, and you go. The mechanics are intricate—gears, derailleurs, chain tension—but you don’t need to know any of that to use one. You feel it working, and that’s enough. The best tools are like this: powerful inside, invisible outside.

There’s also something personal about a bicycle. You feel the road. You feel the weather. You’re exposed, but you’re connected. Cars are isolating. Bikes are amplifying. You don’t just get somewhere; you arrive having experienced the world. That’s rare for a tool. Most tools separate you from the work. Bicycles invite you in.

I think this is why bicycles persist. They’re not just efficient—they’re elegant. They give more than they take. A well-made bike turns work into joy. That’s about the highest praise you can give any tool.
