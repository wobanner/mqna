# Watches
*June 2025*

If you want to understand the essence of mechanical watches, don’t think of them as jewelry. Think of them as tools.

There’s a tendency now to see mechanical watches as status symbols, like yachts or tailored suits. But that view is an artifact of our time, and a superficial one at that. Originally, watches were tools, and serious ones—tools for explorers, engineers, soldiers. When people strapped little ticking machines to their wrists, it wasn’t because they wanted to peacock. It was because they needed to know the time.

And even now, despite quartz and smartphones rendering them technologically obsolete, mechanical watches remain tools. Just not in the way most people think.

A good tool does something simple very reliably. A mechanical watch tells you the time, yes, but the more important thing it gives you is independence. You don’t need to check your phone, which means you’re not pulled into that vortex of attention. A mechanical watch gives you time without noise. That makes it a kind of cognitive tool—an intentional buffer between you and distraction.

There’s also a kind of grounding in mechanical watches. When you wear one, you’re interacting with something made by people, not algorithms. You feel the weight, you hear the tick. There’s a spring inside that winds down, like the fading note of a piano key. That mechanism ties you to physics, to the idea that this device is not abstract. It’s real. It moves because gears mesh and unwind. It’s a reminder that not all precision has to be digital.

This is why engineers and craftsmen often love mechanical watches. Not because they’re “luxury goods,” but because they represent a philosophy. They’re objects that do a single job in an elegant, mechanical way. A sort of protest against disposability.

Ironically, many people who wear mechanical watches today don’t really need them. But maybe that’s the point. They’re not using them out of necessity but as a quiet rebellion against the frictionless everything of the digital world. Like writing in a notebook instead of typing, or sharpening a pencil. They choose the analog path because it feels more human.

So yes, mechanical watches are tools. Not just for telling time, but for reminding us how to spend it.
