# Wellness Ritual
## ”The Slow Morning”

**Phase 1 – _Emberlight_ (10 minutes)**

This is your invitation to wake inwardly, not just physically.
Enter a quiet room and switch on soft, ambient lighting. Let your space cue you into sacred time. Put on a low, ambient playlist (no lyrics). Sit at your desk, upright but not rigid. With your feet on the ground and hands relaxed, take three long, conscious breaths.

Then: gaze softly out a window or into the quiet room. Let the first few minutes be entirely receptive. No need to _do_ anything yet. You’re just being here, gently arriving.

**Phase 2 – _The Inner Flame_ (15 minutes)**

Now shift into your core ritual: journaling.

Free write whatever rises – dream fragments, lingering feelings, or thoughts about the day ahead. Then, transition into intention-setting. Write:

	• One thing I want to feel today
	• One thing I will carry with me today
	• One truth I trust today

If moved to write affirmations, now is the time. Keep them grounded and real, e.g. “I meet the day with steady fire.”

Phase 3 – Gentle Spark (10 minutes)

To bridge the mind and body, close the journal and sit upright again. Gently roll your shoulders. Tilt your head side to side. Do slow neck circles. Place your hands on your thighs and take five slow, audible breaths. 

_Optional: stretch your arms up overhead or twist gently side to side in your seat._

Then, play a fun game like Tetris for 3–4 minutes. Let it activate your pattern recognition and focus, a playful final ignition before you go.

**Anchoring Cues:**

	• Lighting: Always begin with your soft desk lamp. This is your ritual signal.
	• Sound: Use a consistent morning playlist (instrumental, lo-fi, ambient). This trains your brain to shift into quiet focus.
	• Desk setup: Keep your journal and pen always in the same spot, ready for you. Maybe a small object – a stone, photo, or quote – sits nearby to ground you.

**Reset Phrase:**

“I meet the day with guidance to the straight path.”
